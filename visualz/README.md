This is a very experimental app using aiohttp as a backend and react for the frontend.

## Run it in development mode

Both the frontend and the backend support auto-reloading whenever something
 changes, so:

Run `make run-dev-frontend` to start the frontend in dev mode.

Run `make run-dev-backebd` to create the virtualenv and serve the backend.
